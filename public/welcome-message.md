**This instance of the ChatGPT is hosted exclusively for TomTom.**

. . .

Your queries are not shared outside TomTom and the conversations and prompts 
are stored in your local browser only. You can start chatting in the box below. 
Click on `(?)` in the top menu for instructions and release notes.

**Note:** The conversation model is currently fixed to `gpt-35-turbo` to improve 
responsiveness of the system and reduce operational cost significantly.

There's a Slack channel `tomtom-chatgpt` where you can post questions or share
ideas on using Chatty.
