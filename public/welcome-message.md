**This instance of the ChatGPT is hosted exclusively for TomTom.**

----

Your queries are not shared outside TomTom and the conversations and prompts
are stored in your local browser only. You can start chatting in the box below.
Click on `(?)` in the top menu for instructions and release notes.

**Note:** The conversation model defaults to `gpt-35-turbo` to improve
responsiveness of the system (and reduce operational cost).

There's a Slack channel `tomtom-chatgpt` where you can post questions or share
ideas on using Chatty.

## Chatty is updated!

We've added support for image recognition! You can now add one or more images to your
chat by clicking on the camera symbol in the input box. This is supported for `gpt-4o`
conversations only.

The image becomes part of your prompt and you ask Chatty anything about it. Like:
- "Translate text in the image into English"
- "Explain what this diagram means"
- "Create a table of the text this image"
- "What does the error in this screenshot mean?"
- ...and anything else you want to know about the picture.

Have fun!
