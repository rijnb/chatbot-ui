## Chatty is updated!

We've added support for image recognition! You can now add one or more images to your
`gpt-4o` chat by clicking on the camera symbol in the input box. The image becomes part
of your prompt and you ask Chatty anything about it. For example:
- "Translate text in the image into English"
- "Create a table from the data in this image"
- "What does the error in this screenshot mean?"

**Have fun!** ðŸŽ‰
